# vue-apollo-example
Vue Apollo Example Project

This project is made to demonstrate the basic setup of a project with VueJS + Vue Apollo + GraphQL + locally stored data.

I made this because I can't find any other examples of code where persistence of local variables is done in a functional manner.

I do not claim that this is THE correct way to set these things up, but it works!

Check out the resulting app at https://vue-apollo-example.herokuapp.com/
